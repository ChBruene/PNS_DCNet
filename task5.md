# Task 5

Some strange bug lives deep in our code. 
The execution of Task 4 sometimes fails with a higher number of participants and sometimes works.
I think it is due to this, that we get these unreasonable results.
Actually the durations of task 4 and 5 should be similar for a low number.
For high numbers task 5 should do better because the key sharing of task 4 has a exponentially growth. 

## 24 Cryptographer
- Task 4 = 0.046 s
- Task 5 = 23.07 s

## 42 Cryptographer
- Task 4 = 0.059 s
- Task 5 = 41.26 s
